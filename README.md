# Reproducible-DNB-downstream-analysis
This repository contains colorectal cancer single cell transcriptome expression matrix data, pre-processing process; and visual analysis of downstream DNB genes, etc.

We also realize that this project is only semi-processed for now, but all the results of the articles can be objectively and reproduced by this data.
