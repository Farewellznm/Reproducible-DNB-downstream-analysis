# Reproducible-DNB-downstream-analysis
This repository contains colorectal cancer single cell transcriptome expression matrix data, pre-processing process; and visual analysis of downstream DNB genes, etc.

We also realize that this project is only semi-processed for now, but all the results of the articles can be objectively and unbiasedly reproduced by this data.

We'll continue to update and clarify issues that already exist, such as too many irrelevant intermediate processes and unclear analysis processes, and if you have any questions, you can find me by submitting an "issue".
